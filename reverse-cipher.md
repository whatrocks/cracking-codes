# Reverse cipher

* encrypts a message by printing it in reverse order
* 'Hello, world!' -> '!dlrow ,olleH'
* to decrypt, just reverse the encrypted message
* this is a weak cipher, but the code is easy to explain

## notes

* len() is a function that gets the length of a string
* don't forget - strings are zero indexed so the last character is len(str) - 1
* while loop
	* while keyboard
	* the condition
	* the colon
	* a block of code
* a condition is an expression used in a loop statement
* the block of code will execute continually while the condition is true
* Boolean data type has only two vlaues: True or False. These values, or bools, are case sensitive. They are not string values, so you don't put quotes around them
* like any other data type, bools can be stored in values

## comparison operators

* less than
* greater than
* less than or eqal to 
* greater than or equal to
* equal to
* not equal to

String comparisons work similarly to number comparisons
Capitalization matters to Python

## Blocks

A block is one or more lines of code grouped together with the same minimum amoung of indentation (that is the number of spaces in front of the line)
Blocks begin when a line is indennted by four spaces. Any following line that is also indented is part of that block. 
A block ends when there is a line of code when the same indentation as before the block started
