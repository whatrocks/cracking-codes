# Operators

## Math operators
+ | addition 
- | subtraction
* | multiplication
/ | division

# Values


# Integers and Floats

Integers are whole numbers
Floating point numbers are numbers with decimal places

These are data types - there are other data types (like strings)

# Expressions

* Expressions are made up of values (the numbers) connected by operators (the math signs)
* Use the order of operations

# Evaluating Expressions

* Evaluating reduces the expression to a signle value, just like solving a math problem reduces it to a single number: the answer
* Errors are okay!

# Storing Values in Variables

* You can use the assignment operator (=) to store values in variables
* The instruction with = assignment operator is an assignment statement
* Unlike expressions, statements are instructions that that don't evaluate any value - instead they just perform an action.
* Variables store single values, not the expressions they are assigned
* A value by itself is also an expression that evaluates to itself
* Variables can be used in expressions the same way values can

# Overwriting Variables

* You can change the value stored in a variable by entering another assignment statement
* This is called overwriting it

# Variable Names

* Variable names are important. A good one describes the data it contains
* Variable names (like everything else in Python) are case sensitive
