# HACKING THE CAESAR CIPHER WITH BRUTE FORCE

"Arab scholars ... invented cryptanalysis, the science of unscrambling a message without knowledge of the key."
- Simon Singh, the Code book


BRUTE FORCE
A brute force attack tries every possible decryption key for a cipher. Because it is so effective aagains the the Caesar cipher, you shouldn't ever use the Caesar cipher.


"The enemy knows the system" - Claude Shannon, Shannon's maxium. 

Kerckhoff's principle: a cipher should still be secure even if everyone knows how the cipher works and someone else has the ciphertext


STRING FORMATTING (STRING ITERPOLATION)
Easier than concatenation
You can pass in nonstring values


CAESAR
The critical weakness is that there aren't that many possible keys that can be used to encrypt.
