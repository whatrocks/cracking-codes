CONSTANTS
Constants are variables whose values shouldnt be changed when the program runs.

Written in uppercase letters by convention.

Symbol is a common term used in cryptography for a single character that a cipher can encrypt or decrypt.

If statement == if this condition is true, excute the code in the following block. Otherwise if this is False, skip the block.

Note that only one of the blocks in an if/elif/else statmements will be excused. 

You can zero or one but not multiple else statements. It also always comes last because it only executes if none of the conditions evaluate to True. The first statement with a True condition has its block executed. the rest of the conditions, even if they are true, aren't checked.


the *in* operator can connect two strings, and will evaluate to True if the first string is inside the second strong or evaluate to False if not.

The *in* operator can be paired with not, which will do the opposite

* In and Not are case sensitive
* a blank string is always considered to be in any other string


METHODS
* methods are just like functions except their attached to a value with a period.
* most data types have methods
* example: .find() takes one string argument and returns the integer index of where the argument appears in the methods string. If the string index can't be found, then find() returns the integer -1. Find is also case sensitive.

MODULES
Modules are Python programs that contain useful functions. To use these functions, you must first import them using an import statement. To call functions in an imported module, put the module name and period before the function name, like so: module.function()
